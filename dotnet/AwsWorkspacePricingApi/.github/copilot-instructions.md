# Best Practices for .NET Projects with ServiceStack

## Project Structure
- Organize your project following Clean Architecture principles
- Keep your DTOs in a separate project or folder to maintain separation of concerns
- Use feature-based folders rather than technical folders when applicable

## ServiceStack Implementation
- Define DTOs (Request and Response) with clear naming conventions (e.g., `GetUserRequest`, `GetUserResponse`)
- Implement service interfaces (e.g., `IMyService`) for better testability
- Register services in `ConfigureServices` method using the `services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>()` pattern
- Keep services stateless whenever possible

## API Design
- Use meaningful route names that describe the resource
- Follow REST principles for resource naming and HTTP methods
- Implement versioning strategy early (e.g., via URL or headers)
- Use plural nouns for collection endpoints (e.g., `/users` instead of `/user`)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes

## Authentication and Authorization
- Use built-in ServiceStack authentication providers
- Implement JWT authentication for modern applications
- Define clear permission roles and attributes
- Use `[Authenticate]` and `[RequiredRole]` attributes to secure services

## Validation
- Use FluentValidation or ServiceStack's built-in validation
- Implement validation in request DTOs
- Return meaningful validation error messages
- Consider client-side validation for better UX

## Error Handling
- Use global exception handling middleware
- Return proper error response structures
- Log exceptions appropriately
- Consider using problem details format for errors

## Performance Optimization
- Use OrmLite or Dapper for database operations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use async/await patterns consistently
- Consider message-based architecture for scalability

## Testing
- Write unit tests for services and validators
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Use in-memory test fixtures for ServiceStack services
- Use mocks for external dependencies

## Dependency Management
- Keep NuGet packages updated regularly
- Use deterministic builds with package locks
- Consider using NuGet Central Package Management
- Pin dependencies to specific versions to avoid unexpected changes

## Configuration
- Use appsettings.json for configuration
- Use environment-specific settings files (e.g., appsettings.Development.json)
- Use IOptions pattern for strongly typed configuration
- Keep secrets out of source control (use Secret Manager or environment variables)

## Logging
- Use structured logging (Serilog or NLog)
- Log appropriate amount of information at each level
- Consider using correlation IDs for request tracing
- Set up centralized logging for production environments

## Containerization
- Use Docker for containerization
- Create optimized Docker images with multi-stage builds
- Separate dev and production Docker configurations
- Use docker-compose for local development

## Continuous Integration/Deployment
- Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Run tests as part of CI process
- Perform static code analysis
- Use deployment slots for zero-downtime deployments
